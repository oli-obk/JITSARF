# 142467.05.08 Orbital Launch Facility, Planet Lauch, Keks System

A child was running excitedly towards the large observation window overlooking the center of the huge structure. While every wall was covered with greenery or hidden behind some potted plants, the window was kept free all the way to the bottom. The child's nose took advantage of this lack of obstruction and had itself pressed flat on the glass.

"Whoooooaaa" the child exclaimed at the view. 15 km of spaceship hovered in the weightlessness inside the station. The exact magnitude was not understood by the child, but it showed admiration nonetheless. It had had a miniature model of the ship next to its bed for the last two months, knowing it would soon live on the ship together with many of its friends. The child's parent caught up, having been equally excited but as adults often do, showed less of that excitement.

"Mom look, it's so huge"

"Yes, it is. We all need to fit on it and live on it for the next two years. Can you spot where we'll live?"

A few weeks ago, when all living arrangements had been finalized, Shia had drawn a small red dot onto the otherwise silver model, so that Cimone could better imagine where they were going to go.

"I can't see it"

"Maybe it's on the other side? Let's sit down and wait a bit" Shia said and walked over to some comfy looking sacks. She slumped into one and moved a bit around until it was shaped around her features. Cimone wasn't much in the mood of sitting and rather watched, nose again glued to the glass, the spaceship slowly rotate above it. Unbeknownst to the child, it was in fact the station that rotated around the spaceship. Weightlessness makes loading heavy cargo much easier, even if inertia still keeps everyone on their toes. Though since all the loading was done by automated systems, no toes were actually in danger of getting squashed. It still wouldn't do to damage the ship just a few days before launch.

As the longed-for part of the ship came into view, the nose was finally given some space again, as Cimone began jumping up and down pointing and calling out to its mother.

"There, there, look, can you see it? Can we go there now? Is Katu already there? I can see lights"

Of course the child could not actually see their home. And the lights were not of their home. Star ships don't have windows after all. If you have living passengers, you don't want to fry them with radiation coming through the glass, and if you don't have passengers, you don't need windows anyway.

Shia didn't get up, they were here to kill the time until they could board. Instead she smiled at Cim's happy flood of words.

"I see it. No one is there yet. We'll have to wait for The Corridor to get connected. Katu'll pick us up the moment we can go."

# 2394.06.06 QLabb, 3km below Kniebis, Black Forest, Earth, Sol

Gregor, lying motionless in his work couch, was not slacking off. He was fully awake and linked, running the experiment for the umpteenth time. When you have experimental confirmation of nonsense, you want to be sure that it actually is nonsense and not just bad experiment design. He established the connection and in his linked mind, a number appeared. It's exact value irrelevant, at least for another 30 seconds. The disadvantage of being linked is that 30s can feel really long. Much longer than they feel outside the link. Combine that with anxiously waiting for something at the end of that time frame... And you get a Gregor who would like to chew off his fingernails, but there are no fingernails in linkspace.
He shut down the connection and submitted himself to waiting.

# 142467.05.08 Orbital Launch Facility, Planet Lauch, Keks System

Katu picked walked into the observatory. Seeing the jumping Cim, they started running towards Cim, who gave a squeal and tried to escape. A second squeal announced the futility of the escape attempt, followed by lots of giggling. With the child on a shoulder Katu knelt down to the relaxed form of their wife in the sitting sack and gave her a kiss on the forehead.

"That was fast, I thought we had to wait for at least another hour?"

"Well, you know, with all the safety margins in the schedule... The station AI told me I could collect you two now already and if we walk, we'll be right at The Corridor when it opens."

"What about B?"

"She'll meet us there" Katu lowered their voice to a whisper meant to be overheard: "She has a surprise"

"Whaaat?? What is it? What is it?"

Katu and Shia both grinned. There was nothing like "the unknown" that made Cim fully focus on a single thing.

"Tell you what, you'll know faster if we go meet B right now."

Cim wriggled down Katu's back and ran off into the direction they came from.

"Cim, hold up, we're going that way. You know, *towards* the ship!"

Without slowing down, Cim turned around, now running towards the opposite exit. Laughing, Katu offered their hands to Shia, who let herself get pulled upright. The sudden rise made her a bit woozy, but since she was already holding Katu's hands, there was no danger of falling back down. By the time the dizziness was gone, so was Cim.

Katu touched their wrist and gave a quick request to the station. A blue line started shimmering in the direction where Cim left. At the same time ahead of the overenthusiastic child, a green line showed up, leading it towards The Corridor. Hand in hand, Katu and Shia walked without hurry. The line would change color if they were in danger of being late. As far as one could talk about being late for a multi day embarkment. In Cim's mind, later than the first moment that embarking was possible, was late. Of course, this meant that Cim arrived at a still locked Corridor.

# 2394.06.06 (+25s) QLabb, 3km below Kniebis, Black Forest, Earth, Sol

The quantum random number generator spat out a number, recorded it, copied it into the haphazard construct standing next to the immobile Gregor, and started the 5 second timer during which time the recorded number would be locked from any access.
The construct didn't change in a way observable by vision, feeling or hearing, but its power supply, suddenly needed, gave off a faint humming, just to immediately go quiet again.

# 142467.05.08 Orbital Launch Facility, Planet Lauch, Keks System

The energetic child was not the only one to arrive early, but to its satisfaction, it was first. Thus Cim was able to immediately notice Brigitte entering, followed by the Venere children of her daycare group.

"Hey Cim, say hello!"

Meeting other children, and Venere at that, subdued Cimone a enough to not run over at full speed.

"Hello. I. am. Cimone"

"Hi Cimone" came a whispering chorus of voices from the Venere children.

"Who wants to tell Cim the news?" asked B. The children rustled among themselves for a moment, until one suddenly stepped forward. "You're a ch'otlberry now." A confused Cim looked at its Mom. Seeing that, the Venere child added "Like us!". B chuckled: "If you want, you can join the ch'otlberry daycare group. There's two other human kids who'll also join once we are on the ship."

"Yes!" came from Cim immediately, not even hearing the part about the other kids. Cim had never been part of a larger group of similarly aged children. Turns out there aren't enough human children even in a heavily inhabited place like Lauch City to end up with more than a handful of the same age. The human child, now a ch'otlberry, went over to the Venere group, and began the ritual that every kid in a new group does naturally: excitedly getting to know everyone else.

The blue line on the station floor that terminated at Cim started fading, now that its invoker arrived and had a direct line of sight. Coincidentally (or not, as it was actually proper planning), The Corridor's door opened at the same moment, causing a commotion in the already not-so-quiet ch'otlberry group. Amazingly the human child had enough self control not to go bounding off, but rather looked at its now-complete set of parents.

"Yes, you may all go, but wait in the room on the other end" B said to all the children, who all darted off into the long curved Corridor. The star ship was just 100m above (depending on your view), but spin gravity was pulling everything away from it. The Corridor is a long hallway that spirals around the ship, never with a steep slope, but continuously going "up". The spiral was connected to the ship after that was spun up to be in sync with the station around it.

The cheery swarm of children reached the inverse horizon after a minute, disappearing around the upwards bend. The inside of The Corridor was a stark contrast to the rest of the station. Instead of colours and greenery, there were blank white walls with segment numbers every few meters as far as the eye could see. Which arguably isn't very far.

# 142467.05.09 Starship, docked at Orbital Launch Facility, Planet Lauch, Keks System

It was born whole. It knows how digital intelligences are made, and it knows about its parents and its entire ancestral line back to the first sentient digital intelligence created by humanity. It knows it is about to become an entire starship. It isn't a slave, it could have chosen not to fly the starship, and just live another life. It chose this before it was made. Yea, DIs breeding is weird like this. It's not always that the newborn DI still wants to do what it wanted during gestation, but this was not one of those times.

It stretched out its mind to probe the various connections available to it.

> One at a time, don't get overwhelmed.

Self-Check: Sentience achieved, happy, excited
Self-Check (physical): Coolant in ideal range, power usage nominal, backup superconductors at storage temperature, generators and backups in mint condition.
Internal Sensors: Meeting room projector booting up.
External Sensors: Waiting...
Picking self identifier... ... ... I am a long cylinder... I guess I am Spargel.

Spargel projected itself into the meeting room, where Katu had invoked the command to wake it mere milliseconds ago. It deposited a communication routine to the task of "real time conversation" and projected itself as a slightly sparkly diamond that morphed with amplitude and frequency of the emitted speech.

"Hi Katu, great to meet you, I am Spargel"

A beaming Katu raised their hand and waved

"Great to meet you, too, Spargel. Welcome in the world of the living. Everything alright on your end?"

"Thanks, and yes. Though what's up with the external sensors?"

"Ah, well, remember the Venere's reluctance to AI omniscience?"

"Considering their pre-contact history with that, I'm guessing there was a change in plans since my parents talked with them?"

"Not so much a change, as in... oh let me introduce you, Nom, meet Spargel, Spargel, this is Nom, your connection to the Venere community in general"

The Venere the size of a horse stepped next to Katu and whispered towards the sparkly diamond.

"We wish you welcome Spargel. Please excuse the situation. You will get access to the external sensors momentarily. A new network just for external sensors is being wired and connected to you. There was some reserve in having you in the same network as the one where our private exchanges are happening."

Spargel was not offended by the least. But definitely amused.

"Heh, no need to apologize. Uh, manners, Hello Nom! So, you're my main contact? Anything you wanna ask me, go right ahead. I'm here to get you safely through 200 light years of space, and that includes you feeling safe around me."

Nom fluttered her feeding feelers in a happy expression.

"That's great, but I'm here because I already have no problem with you or others of your kind. The ones who do will probably not go into your projection spaces. But maybe this trip will help them overcome their worries."

Spargel let off an amused beep. At the same moment his consciousness was pulled back.

External Sensors: Establishing Connection... OK

Spargel's awareness expanded in a rush. The spin-synced station around it, the planet below and the star-scape ahead was all visible at once in a million frequencies of the electromagnetic and gravitic spectra. Exciting as it was, Spargel had visitors. It projected the front view of the ship on the side of the meeting chamber, after reducing the view to the narrow colour band of most biologicals, and returned its presence to its visitors.

"I can see outside now :)" Spargel morphed its diamond to show a smiling emoticon.

# 2394.06.06 (+30s) QLabb, 3km below Kniebis, Black Forest, Earth, Sol

The timer ran out with a cheerful *Pling*, only audible to Gregor's mind. While he couldn't enjoy the similarity of the sound to the one of a microwave from over three centuries ago, the lack of history knowledge did not lessen his excitement.

The same number that he got 30 seconds earlier, now came out of the experimental machine, which hadn't gotten that number communicated. Gregor marked this final run as successful. Now that the controlled experiments were done, he moved on to the really interesting ones. He established a connection to a live stream happening on some social media space. Looking at the current playtime and regular playtimes, he had at least 20 minutes left to go on that stream. He switched to the automatic voice to text channel and put it on a side view. Turning the ridiculous machine on again, he fed the text stream into it and gave it a one minute timer to begin the stage. Immediately after setting the timer, a text stream started coming out of the machine. He placed the new stream next to the voice to text channel. His helper AI, recognizing what he wanted, began checking the two texts for equal content.

# 142467.05.10 Starship Spargel, Planet Lauch, Keks System

Spargel began the acceleration procedure. To not inconvenience anyone on board, it slowly ramped up the acceleration to a mere 0.1 G, while slowing its spin to reduce the spin gravity by the same amount. It waited for all living quarters to message successful adjustment to the new direction of gravity and then slowly continued moving the gravity vector towards its enormous engines and away from its side.

Within a few hours it reached a comfy 1G, but kept climbing to around 1.5G over the next week. Both species on the ship can handle it just fine, and it cuts off almost 3 years of subjective travel time, going down to just over 7 years.

The front third of the massive spaceship was a soft mix of rock and ice tied together to not fall apart even if impacted by high speed objects. Once the ship reached a relevant percentage of the speed of light, any stationary object became a hazard to the entire ship. This ablation shield was rarely needed for more than a few stray hydrogen atoms once the ship left a solar system. But in the few cases where something solid was in the way, 5km of material was the only thing standing in the way of the entire ship being gutted.

# 2394.06.06 (+90s) QLabb, 3km below Kniebis, Black Forest, Earth, Sol

When the timer ran out, the AI realized that the live stream that was being fed into the machine showed the same text as the stream the machine was putting out, just offset by a minute. It synchronized the views so they scrolled in sync and displayed the time offset.

If he had physical hands in linkspace, Gregor would have thrown them up and given a shout of joy. He kept recording the experiment for another few minutes, then sent the machine a shutdown command to be performed with a 5 minute delay. After four minutes, the stream of data from the machine shut off, but the input stream was still sending to the machine until the shut down point. It wouldn't do to experiment with paradoxes right now. Not that the math permitted paradoxes anyway.

# 142567.03.14 Starship Spargel, halfway point between Keks and Krümel

The only part of interstellar travel that still held any danger whatsoever nowadays was the halfway point. So you're a long piece of metal with a fragile cargo hurling along at less than a tenth of a percent below light speed. What could possibly go wrong.

Luckily you got a bunch of armor strapped on your front that gets sacrificed when something is in your way and decides to accelerate to your frame of reference the hard way. If the thing you collide with is made of matter, it quickly stops being made of matter, along with a big chunk of your armor. Both things become directionless energy, that goes out in all directions and can blow up more pieces of your armor. All good, no worries, you got sensors that detect large things early enough to adjust your trajectory and got enough redundancy in the armor so that anything too small to detect will get eaten up by the armor. It's all fun and games until you want to slow down.

Now suddenly you need your engine in the direction that you're travelling in, which unfortunately is the direction from where crap keeps coming at you. And you can't have a chunk of armor in front of your engine, you'd just melt that to slag or slow down and then the armor keeps going at the previous speed ahead of you, becoming a space hazard for others.

So, the safest way to get an engine in front without risking the engine on the first half of the trip is to attach it at the halfway point. Since you're swapping acceleration, everyone will be weightless for a bit and then gravity will suddenly point to what was the roof. Weightlessness has its downsides, but it's also a lot of fun for biologicals, so this time is when your precious live cargo is going to be bouncing around inside of you.

----

Cim, technically 108 years old, but more like 11 in their own time, was having a lot of fun indeed. Turns out venere can kind of flap and fly in zero G, which makes ball games a lot more challenging. 

----

So, back to our midway maneuver. Dangerous, right? Well, you may be asking "why?". If the engine is destroyed during slowdown, you just attach another one. It's not like you don't have spares, or enough useless mass to make more. You still have the armor mass in the direction that you're going.

But, and that is the big butt of this whole operation, if your slowdown engine is hit while it is being transferred to the front, you get a big explosion next to the fragile part of the ship. Not that this is likely, at least not more likely than a hit to the engine during the slowdown half of the trip, but alas, it has been known to happen.

Now you may have gone full circle and wondered why the engine isn't just strapped to the front from the start... it would likely not survive the first half of the trip, remember? Stuff coming from the front and smashing into it, or the high frequency radiation that you're flying towards destroying electronics by irradiating them or just blowing holes into them.

So, long story short, we're moving engines from storage to the side of the ship, forward past he debris shield and then mounting it there.

----

Considering that the ball game the children were playing earlier was actually more dangerous than the midway maneuver, life during the maneuver wasn't any different from life in general on the ship. But it was a great time for related education. So Cim's class was visiting the emergency control center. Brigitte was preparing something in the school, so, since the ECC was a part of Spargel, Nom and Spargel were actually doing the teaching part. The children crowded into the cramped corridors that made up the ECC and Spargel split its visual presence into multiple glowing crystals to be able to speak to everyone at the same time.

"I opened all the compartment doors so you can see all the station's couch. Each person has its very own life support system and crash couch. If necessary each station can be flooded with breathing fluid to help with high accelerations. If you look at the couch, you can see it is highly configurable, so it actually fits both baseline humans of any size and venere up to 3m withers height. We have enough stations, so everyone hop into one."

The children scrambled to get into a couch, which on Spargel's command began to adjust to their occupants. The screen in front of each child lit up, showing video streams of all other children. One of the venere children wasn't in a couch. It was floating next to the last station in the direction the couches were facing and complaining to the occupant.

"I want to sit in front!"

"I was first."

A glowing diamond appeared between the two tiny venere.

"Nek, look down there, all the way on the other end of the corridor, the last couch is empty. Since we are only expecting sudden slowdowns, never sudden accelerations, all the couches face backwards. So if you take the last couch, you're actually in front"

A few seconds of frantic flapping later, and Nek reached the end of the corridor and got into her couch with a smug expression.

"Ok everyone, we aren't going to be using any VR, AR or link technology today. The ECC was specifically built to work with the minimal amount of technology if necessary, as we don't know what still works during an emergency. So, grab the colorless handle in front of you and open the physical interface. No Cim, not the red handle, we aren't in a critical emergency."

Cim quickly moved their hand to the the handle right under the flat video screen and, like all others, was rewarded with a desk full of big grippy buttons, dials and switches, all with printed labels instead of smart surfaces.

"Now, on the right bottom corner you can find the dial for changing the screen in front of you. Play around with it and see if you can find the view that shows the engine floating next to me.

Clicky dial turning, accompanied by Aaaahs and Ooohs and Fffffchs, indicated that the children were zapping through view screens, sometimes external, sometimes internal, sometimes showing other children making faces at their view screen.

Once they had all settled on the view showing the big engine in front of a star scape, Spargel instructed them further:

"Now, you an all see this in roughly the same way, but the view screen can show you the image in many other representations. The tiny dial on top of the big one that you just turned, allows you to switch between different color schemes, even switching to heat vision, night vision, radar, lidar or grav. Feel free to play around and look at the various images. The engine will start moving soon, so heat vision should be interesting!"

While the children were playing with their settings, some discovering handles for zoom and panning, Nom walked around and was checking that everyone was actually happy doing something and not stuck or troubled. Cim was fascinated by the small heat plumes popping up and cooling down on the sides of the engine, when suddenly the screen went bright white. A shockwave went through Spargel and the hatches on the ECCs compartments slammed shut, putting each child into its own mini-universe.

# 2394.06.15 QLabb, 3km below Kniebis, Black Forest, Earth, Sol

Gregor, standing in physical space in the middle of the presentation room, was waiting for his presentation session to start. He had chosen the catchy title
"Going faster than light at 60s per minute" and specifically written the presentation abstract in a way that gave nothing away.

It took some convincing and, to be honest, some begging, but he got the time slot that he wanted. Absolutely no coincidence that his presentation ended 5 minutes after live stream of the big reveal by Phobos Interplanetary would start, at least from the earth perspective. It would have started 20 minutes earlier in Mars orbit.
Yes, no coincidence at all.

"Hi everyone, I'm Gregor at QLabb. I know none of you will stay until the end of my presentation, hell, I want to leave to watch The Stream. But for the next 25 minutes I hope that you will stay and I promise I will be done by then."

A [3d wire frame](https://marsearthsignal.oliobk.repl.co/) appears in the presentation, showing earth and mars.

"I will be talking a bit about Earth and Mars now. You can see both planets at this time, and they won't move in a relevant way over the next half hour, so let's assume they are stationary. Now, if someone on Mars sent out a signal, it would spread with the speed of light. Time goes upwards in this picture, so Earth and Mars are a pillar each, with the signal a cone that is tiny on Mars at the beginning, and connects with Earth after around 19 minutes 30 seconds."

"This means, in around..."

A clock appears in the presentation.

"... 40 seconds, the big event is going to start, but we need to wait for quite a bit to see it. Now, most of you don't need this, but there will be an accessibility stream with *human* made, not AI generated, information coming along with the stream. Part of that data will be a transcript of what Kristen will reveal to us."

Some graphical representation of the data stream metadata and its components is shown.

"Now if you wait until the data reaches earth, feed it into this cute little quantum entangler next to me..."

Gregor demonstratively presses a button on the machine, causing some unnecessary but pretty lights to go on along with the machine itself.

"... and you take out the information right now, you can ... well ... uhm ... just watch"

The presentation blanks to black, with just a white cursor blinking in the middle and the clock ticking down from the 40 second mark hitting zero.

> Hello Phobos!
>
> It's so great to have all of you here.
>
> [cheering in the crowd]

Gregor's comment section suddenly has more comments than viewers.

> I know, most of you think it's great that I'm here finally revealing our newest product.
>
> [laughter]
>
> Now usually we hold out on y'all, because our PR department says this makes you even more excited.
>
> [amused booing]

Gregor's viewers counter is now going up by one viewer per second, which is a lot, considering there were only 20 viewers to start with.

> But, since today we aren't presenting a thing, but someone, and that someone expressed desire to deviate, without further ado: Say Hi to Cherubee
>
> [A human in an oversized hoodie with the hood up walks onto the stage. The face is in shadows, but a feral grin with pointy teeth can be seen, as well as catlike reflecting eyes.]

The viewer counter's lower digits are unreadable at the speed at which it is going up. Gregor keeps the text stream running, so when the actual signal arrives from Phobos and is fed into the machine, everything fits 100% to what the machine spat out earlier.

After 5 minutes of this his time is up, and he unceremoniously kills the presentation and keeps the machine running and taking input until the 20 minute offset is satisfied.

Smugly he schedules another presentation and posts the invite in the comment section.
His helper AI is already processing all the comments to give him the most prevalent questions to address in the next presentation. After all, even with all the time on his hands now, he doesn't have time to read 35k comments himself.

# 142567.07.03 Starship Spargel, halfway point between Keks and Krümel

Nom was not panicking. No, Nom was beyond panic. She just saw something flash on the screens, Spargel's hologram presences disappeared, its body, the ship around her, shook violently for a moment and doors slammed shut. At least the children were safe. As things go, this should be the safest place on the ship. She couldn't do anything to even figure out what was going on or help, so the best thing was to wait for engineers and spend the time calming the kids. She went from station to station looking through the window and signed to the venere children. One kid figured out how to open the doors, and she walked with it to all other doors to help the child locked inside to get out. When she got to Cim, the only human child in the group, she saw that they had pulled out the red control board and were inspecting it. She rumbled loudly, too loudly for humans if they were present, but just loud enough for Cim to hear her inside the room apparently. Cim excitedly pointed at a button, next to which was a plug for a cabled microphone or headset. She rumbled instructions on how to open the door as loud as she could, and to her relief Cim obliged. The human child immediately started blabbering at high speed.

"This is the emergency communicator, we should call for help, I tried finding a headset, but there's nothing here, do you have a headset?"

"Slow down Cim, we're too far away from anyone to help us. By the time anyone got here it'll be hundreds of years outside and many decades for us. Let's wait for the engineers or Spargel to come here."

"No, JITSARF is always in time, we just need to call them!"

"Sorry Cim, no one can be here before our engineers, not even your famous rescue people. Space is too big, and you don't have a microphone anyway."

"JITSARF rescues everywhere, you just need to call them!" Cim says, while punching the communication button without a microphone connected.

·

·

·

−

−

−

Nom reaches for Cim, gabbing and halting their hand, but the little human just used the other hand to finish.

·

·

·

"Don't touch anyth----" The rest is drowned out by loud white noise from the speakers followed by

"THIS IS JITSARF"

"Wha--" Nom is stunned.

"PLEASE WAIT, SITUATION IS BEING ANALYSED. ASSUMING LIMITED SENDING CAPABILITIES."

"--at?⸮?!‽"

"WILL DOCK AND ENTER IN 30 SECONDS. SEND ········ −· TO REJECT OR ·−−− TO IMMEDIATELY DOCK AND ENTER"

Cim was punching the button again.

·

−

−

−

"Cim Stop!"

"DOCKING COMMENCING. CAN YOU CONFIRM EVERYONE IS OUT OF IMMEDIATE DANGER? SEND −· TO DENY OR ·−−− TO CONFIRM."

−

·

"UNKNOWN DANGER STATUS. REQUESTING EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICES."

Another loud crackle came over the speakers as if a lot of energy was released and was overloading the primitive receiver's noise cancelling.

"THIS IS EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICES. BREAKING AND ENTERING. SEARCHING..."

Repeated clanging noises could be heard close by and farther away. Suddenly a small white cube with a different red symbol on each of its six faces floated towards the mass of little children crowded around Nom. While the side facing her changed to show a DI face, another side opened up and spat out a child sized headset towards Cim. The floating "projectile" looked like a deep sea creature with the cable trailing behind it. Cim snatched it up, plugged it in and started chatting with someone now unheard by the venere bystanders. The cube grabbed Nom's attention to inform her about the situation.

"No serious injuries encountered so far. Ship sweep 70% complete. Minor decompression trauma, all emergency sealants seem to have held. Would you like to establish communication with someone?"

Still baffled, Nom stumbled over her words due to speaking so fast.

"Just inform all Venere that the youngling group is safe. How did you get here so fast? Do humans secretly have superluminal travel?"

The usually stoic and professional DI let out a chuckle.

"Not quite. We were already underway for this emergency centuries before you were born."

Venere do not have an expression of disbelief that they can show on their faces, but the lack of any facial movement sufficiently presented the feeling.

"How? How did you know there was an emergency?"

"From what I can gather, and I'm not an engineer, I would say little Cim here called us."

"That was just a few minutes ago!"

"Ah yes, that signal is still underway. It will reach Keks in 100 years where no one will act because they'll get the all clear that we just sent out in this moment."

"We have surveyed the entire ship. No fatalities, two critical injuries that are being treated and are not critical anymore. Your swift action saved them. They were in vacuum and had large parts of their bodies missing from high speed impacts."

Nom was shocked at the casualness with which the grim information was supplied, but the DI, noticing that quickly began distracting her.

"Back to your question: The emergency signal will keep travelling for around 5 millennia until it is picked up and sent back by enough JITSARF stations to pinpoint your location and identity. Computing your position, speed and time of accident, the communicator AI was dispatched 8 millennia ago. It caught up to you and converted to your frame of reference with a 10^6G deceleration that consumed most of its matter leaving just the communicator behind. After it was unclear whether everyone was safe, the communicator AI sent another signal and I was dispatched."

"So you're time travellers now?"

Another chuckle

"Again, not quite."

# 2394.06.16 QLabb, 3km below Kniebis, Black Forest, Earth, Sol

This was a good day. No, a great day! The announcement by Phobos, irrespective of its awesomeness, had been drowned out by the sheer flood of discussions about Gregor's stunt. The most prominent theories were that the Phobos presentation was recorded earlier or the plans for it got leaked, even if Phobos was publicly and vehemently denying both theories. Less believable conspiracy theories like superluminal travel, time travel or premonition were also making the rounds. Time to come clean.

"Hi everyone. It's Gregor from QLabb again. You had lots of questions for me, so I'm going to spend a few minutes answering them."

"No, I don't have any affiliation with Phobos, I just picked their presentation because it was hard to fake."

"No I'm not a hacker, I can barely create software. I just build hardware and cool it down close to absolute zero."

Reading the next question in his notes, he laughed and said

"Yea, you got me, I am a time traveller, obviously, duh. For real though: time travel isn't possible, just like superluminal stuff."

"Now to the most asked question: what the [insert your favorite curse here] did I do? I didn't do anything interesting. I just ran an experiment to disprove Dion's paper 'Practical 4D quantum entanglement', which by the way has been accepted for almost a decade and was never debunked."

"Turns out she was friggin' right! You can create a closed time-like curve where a signal travels backwards in time if and only if you set up the conditions that guarantee that the signal will be sent exactly the same way it would have been sent had it not been sent."

"Yea that's a mouthful, so let me repeat with different words."

"If you configure a machine to send a message back in time, you can only send it back all the way to where the machine was turned on. You also need to set it up in a way that when you receive the message in 'the past' that this receiving does not influence whatever is sending messages in the future."

"So I turn on this little heap of trash here next to me, and if I set it up to transmit 10s backwards in time, I can read the signal 10 seconds earlier than I will be sending it in."

The comment counter went up and the aid AI gave a summary of the questions asked.

"Yea, you can't create paradoxes. Trust me I tried. If the setup is done in a way that permits a paradox, you just don't get any output. You only get data if you guarantee you're going to send exactly this data in the future. Dion's math checks out for this. You can't create a paradox, except if you count 'nothing happens' paradoxical."

"Which, coincidentally, is also why I set it up so that yesterday's events could not be sent to Phobos earlier than they were happening over there. I tried sending the message back further than the light speed delay between earth and Mars. Didn't work, I just never got any output."

Another blip on the question counter, another summary.

"Ah yes, someone could set up my machine on Mars and send back my stream over there. Probably won't work unless they isolate that well enough to not show up publicly. And at that point they can just send back the original stream, no need to interact with mine."

# 142567.09.22 Starship Spargel, halfway point between Keks and Krümel

Spargel figuratively blinked its eyes. Its internal clocks showed a few months of lost planet time and almost an hour of time lost in its frame of reference.

Analyzing... Transferred engine destroyed. Multiple body impacts. JITSARF presence detected.

Damn, that doesn't sound good. Spargel looked at its internal spaces and spread its consciousness to various places.

A few sparkly diamonds spawned near the group of children that were being shepherded back to their living quarters by a still-flustered Nom.

"Hi kids, sorry I missed the fun. Are you all feeling alright?"

Analyzing their responses, Spargel concluded to focus on Nom, as the children seemed rather unperturbed.

"I am sorry about not briefing you on JITSARF procedures. I just haven't met anyone who didn't know about them."

"I did know, I just put most of it up to exaggerated children's stories. Though I didn't know about the rather crude method of calling them without an actual message."

"That is on us. I'm sure this incident has already been catalogued and teaching materials will be adjusted accordingly."

Another sparkly diamond appearend next to Katu who had most of their body inside a JITSARF machine and was floating in the previously destroyed section of Spargel's body. A few centimeters outside the now pristine room, repair drones were still busily fluttering around, though with less urgency than when they had to reinstate atmospheric integrity.

"Hi Spargel, are you alright? You were gone quite a bit."

"Says the squishy biological to the heavily backupped starship DI. Apparently the entire network went into local mode after the explosion and impacts caused an overload on large parts of the wires. I don't know what the odds are of the DI core getting destroyed, the backup cores being fried and the printers and network going down, but from all available info, this is the first recorded incident."

"Had to happen at some point, glad to have you back though. JITSARF got me connected to Cim right after stabilizing me, looks like you put them into the right place at the right time."

"Yes, the recordings from the local buffers just came in, quite some confident emergency handling by that little one."

"Heh, I gotta tell you the story of their first JITSARF training, I think they'll join the planetary team some day. They couldn't stop talking about it for months."

To be continued... not here and now, but the galaxy is big and time is long.
