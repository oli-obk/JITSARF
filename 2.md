# JIT - Founding a colony is expensive, unless you don't have any safety margins

## 3210.12.11 Europa Orbit, Sol

Hi Mom, we did it, we got (just) enough funds together to do a one-way trip to Wolf 1069 (nice! right?). It's just our little group, and apparently we're the first to go there. No habitable planets, so there's also little chance of anyone going there in the forseeable future. It's going to be awesome. We couldn't get a solar sail printer to take with us, so we'll have to bootstrap that when we get there. There's more than enough resources floating in the inner asteroid belt, ripe for our taking without a friggin gravity well.

So... The lag will be horrible (60 years, lol), also we'll drop out of communication range 2 years into the trip :( we tried to get something with a longer range, but those things are expensive. So if you don't hear from me for the next 100 years or so don't worry, we got this. You know Jasper, right? He can fix anything with a lazchiv and some glue.

We'll be leaving around new years, and because most of us never lived in gravity, we won't travel faster than a third of a G. I'll still only age half as fast during the trip, how cool is that?!

## 3211.01.01 Europa Orbit, Sol, +1 month

Hi Mom, the ship has a direction now, I'm falling towards you but flying away from you. It's still confusing to me, even after all those trips you took me on. Anyway, we *are under thrust* as the techies say. It'll take a bit for us to get to speed, and we don't have much space, but everyone got linkspace implants, so we got all the space we need. 

## 3211.04.03 Somewhere outside the Sol system +4 months

Hi Mom, we started drawing up plans for our habitat, and Jasper helped me design my own sailing ship. I'm taking flying lessons in linkspace now. Someone brought an old book, like the really old paper stuff, I don't know if they stole it from a conservatory, but it's so weird, you have to be careful not to break it while reading. It's got some really odd wording and font, but it's cool. It's about sailing ships in Sol flying between habitats. There's pirates and treasures and stuff. But don't worry, according to the story you have a few millennia until society in the Sol system breaks down that far.

## 3211.10.07 A bit further outside the Sol system +11 months

Hi Mom, uh, cool, but surprising news: Jimmy's pregnant. Originally everyone wanted to wait until we got there, but... he forgot to get his implant refreshed, and then forgot that he forgot. Don't worry, we got a really nice medbay. Our family's going to grow so soon. I attached a scan. Love you, bye.

## 3211.10.15 Not really further than last time

Hi Mom, Jimmy's fine. I just wanted to send you a message sooner this time. Now I forgot why. Damn, should have started with the why and edited in something about everyone being fine later. Ah, got it, so, uh, I took more solar sailing lessons and managed my first slingshot maneuver with deployed sails now. No, sorry, that's not what I wanted to say. That's cool, too, but uh, so, about the pregnancy thing. We don't want a child to be alone for a long time, so we've been thinking. We can stretch our recycling and reprocessing capacities to manage another two or three children during the flight. So, uh, you may become a grandma. I'm one of the people who now got their implants taken out. We couldn't decide on who, because everyone was offering up their slot to everyone else. So... we let the computer pick three random parents. I got picked. I'm so excited.

## 3211.11.15 Still not really further

Hi Mom, it's been a month. Jimmy's still fine. The medbay says that everything is stabilized now after getting rid of that implant. I'll let you know when stuff changes... You know, stuff.

## 3211.12.07 Emotionally a lot further

Hi Mom, tada, you're gonna be a grandma. Look at the scan! Love ya, bye.

## 3211.12.08 ...

Uh, this time actually with the scan.

## 3211.12.24 Two steps forward, one step back, +13 months, 10 months ship time

Hi Mom, I hate this, even with the meds I'm sick. I just wanna cry all the time. I wish you were here. I get lots of cuddles, but still...

## 3211.12.25 ...

[crying noises] Mom [sniffling], I, everything sucks. Why did I ever do this. I'm so far away from you.

## 3211.12.28 Oops

Hi Mom, so... turns out the scanner wasn't picking up some hormone levels correctly. Jasper fixed it and my meds got adjusted. I'm all good again. Whoever invented depressants deserves getting a stern disapproving look. Everything is peachy again.

## 3212.05.07 Picking up speed, +1.5 years, 1 year ship time

Hi Mom, I got your message. Love you, too. I'm glad you're happy. We're travelling so fast now, that you'll soon not be able to pick up our messages anymore. In 8 years or so we should be able to bounce stuff via the colony on Cyg, so you're gonna hear from me in 20-ish years. I attached lots of scans (yes really this time). The little one will be like 4 years old when you get the next messages from us. I'll send pictures of all four kids. I love you.

## 3220.01.01, 9 years, 3 years ship time

Hi Mom, we've been picking up messages from Cyg for a while now, but we're also flying somewhat towards it. We should be able to send now, so I hope this reaches you. We'll keep repeating the messages until we're sure they got through.

Lizzy, say hi to grandma! Isn't she a cutie, mom? The kids have been quite a handful, but it's not like we have much to do during the trip, well, now we do! Look, we painted all the walls, so it's really comfy here, even without link implants.

## 3226.02.28 Halfway there, 14 years, 4 years ship time

Hi Mom, we're half the way there. We've been picking up signals from Alsafi, I didn't even know there was anyone there. We're going to ask them to forward our messages, so you may hear more from us soon. The ship is so fast right now that our signals are actually strong enough to reach them. We'll be slowing down now, though. Anyway, everyone is doing well. We started a school. It's pretty chaotic teaching, but we knew that, and it doesn't look like anyone is unhappy with it. We don't have the resources to give the children implants, but once we start mining at Wolf, we should be able to get them some quickly. It's going to be interesting to see them learn linkspace as teenagers instead of as preschoolers.

## 3242.11.07 Wolf 1069 (nicknamed Tennice) 30 years, 8 years ship time

Hi Mom, this message is not gonna get sent for a while, but I wanted to put it into the buffer. We've slowed down all the way and are now floating next to a big chunk of ice and metals. Jasper's scanners found this one really early, and we're going to build our rendezvous here. There are going to be three sailing ships, and we meet here once a year. We did cut it a bit close here supply-wise, but we made it. The icers are going to grab us new water soon and then we can all relax.

## 3242.11.09 Somewhere close to Rendezvous, Tennice

We messed up. We've got two ppl stuck on Rendezvous and everyone else is here, and we got no way to get them and the ice back here. They got our small thruster, and it broke when they landed. We only got the big one, but that's not controllable enough to get there without making more of a mess than we already have. Jasper rigged a bunch of canisters onto one of the EVA suits, and will fly over there to try to fix it. It's a one way trip, but he'll refill them with ice over on Rendezvous.

I'm scared Mom.

[crackle on the radio]

Jasper here, get the radio to engie, fast, no don't ask, just hurry!

[A person can be seen floating away at unsafe zero-G speeds. Shortly after, they come back.]

[sniffle] Jasper is going too fast and can't stop. He'll crash into Rendezvous in a few minutes and we can't do anything. He's talking with the engies, he doesn't want to speak with me [sniffle]. [loud banging noises] What was that? Hey, what was that? Be right back, Mom.

[The person leaves again, at less unsafe speeds this time, only to return quickly with less of a frown on their face.]

Uh, they "unplugged" [visually doing air quotes with their hands] the whole engine section and sent it towards Alsafi with a broadcast asking for JITSARF. They say that should work. I thought you had to send messages, but they say the message can be sent by ship, too. I hope they are rig-- [inaudible] [Loud crackle from speakers in the background]

THIS IS JITSARF. PLEASE WAIT, SITUATION IS BEING ANAL-- OH SHIT

[Loud crackle]

OH FUCK

[Loud crackle] [Loud crackle]

Uh, Mom? You ever heard JITSARF curse? Hold up.

[A second radio is grabbed from off-screen]

Jasper, JITSARF is here!

I see something coming towards me real fast and bright. It slowed down -- whoa, argml [sounds of distress].

Jasper! What's happening?

I'm ok, I just got quite a kick to prevent a harder one when hitting Rendezvous.

Sorry mom, talk to you later.

[video feed terminated]

## 3242.11.09 ...

[whispers] *Hi Mom, we got Jasper and the icers back.* [Two adults and a child can be seen snuggling in front of the camera.] *Never letting him do that again. JITSARF said they'll help us get started. Everything's gonna be fine.*

## 3243.06.13 Citta di Ragusa, unspecified orbit, Tennice

Hi Mom, we got our own sailing ship now, the Citt√† di Ragusa. The printers and diggers at Rendezvous are busy building our meeting complex, and we're sailing through the belt looking for resources and just mapping the whole place. Everything is manual, wheels and levers and telescopes and stuff. We only got electricity here for the computer, for the active sensors and for the squawk. Oh, and JITSARF called us reckless and forced all of us to carry a JITSARF emergency flare. Pop it open and press the button in case of emergency they said. Never seen that, is that new? Anyway, they asked us to let them leave some nodes around the sun, since this is our system. We let them, but they can't have anything else here, we came here to escape the whole "everything is linked" stuff. We're building our own sender in Rendezvous, so you'll get this message when we get back and celebrate our full autonomy by turning on the sender on our terms.

...

Love you!
