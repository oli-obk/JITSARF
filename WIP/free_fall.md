# 5034.10.21 Edge of Olympus Mons, Mars, Sol

It was a quiet day at the Seven K Visitor Center. Most visitors today were families who came down the space elevator to see [the cliff](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/multimedia/pia12992.html) and keep the kids busy while waiting for their slot in the Earth transfer accelerator.

Tiberius, age 10, donned his helmet and had his entire suit checked out by the airlock attendant. Once the rest of his family caught up, the airlock cycled and they all walked out onto the glass floored platform hanging over the cliff. It was a ridiculous sight. It went down so far, that some parts had clouds pushing against the cliff and disappearing in the updraft.

At the far end, there was a small gated area that you could pay to get in. Tiberius saw some other kids in there. Each was given a flare that they could light and throw out a small hole in the fence. The flare could then be see falling for kilometers before it disappeared into clouds or just became too tiny to see. At night this would probably be an even more spectacular sight, but Tiberius was already fascinated. He went to his parents and bugged them for long enough that they just buckled and let him do it. A few minutes later when the excitement was over, Tiberius and his family continued on the suggested path around the visitor center. While that was focussed on the cliff out of obvious reasons like its name, it also had a museum cut into the rock. With lots of interactive parts, holographic renderings of the first unpowered climb, and a small bouldering wall, Tiberius was both entertained and worn out. The last part of the suggested path went back to the visitor center along the cliff. Without an overhanging platform, there was a fence a few meters off the cliff, so one could not get too close to the edge. Like with many small children, this just made it more interesting to try to get closer. In a moment of inattention by his parents, he climbed over the fence (quite an achievement in the environment suit) and started walking towards the edge. Several warning lights went off on the ground itself as well as in his suit and all the suits nearby. A warning message told him to stop, which just startled him and made him trip. Falling down in the bulky suit caused him to roll over the edge and, to the shock of his parents, disappear behind it.

A visitor center employee came running and was donning climbing gear, while the stunned parents went into panic. The employee made a well trained leap to the top of the fence and swung over it, landing safely away from the edge. Quickly attaching a rope to a fence post, the employee leapt over the edge, surprising everyone. A video feed from the employee's headcam appeared on the parents' visor showing them their reckless son safely entangled in a permanently installed web.

The employee climbed to Tiberius and attached themselves with multiple connectors to Tiberius. It took some complicated untangling from the net which was built to ensnare anything it caught to prevent climbing out of it. The employee the climbed up the short piece of cliff wall and dragged Tiberius over the edge. The public radio channel went up in noise as all the spectators started cheering.

## Six years later

Tiberius was back at the cliff. This time alone, with a purpose and prepared. The visitor center suits were still bulky, but anything else would be suspicious. He didn't want to be suspicious. All he brought was a JITSARF flare, a small camdrone swarm and some serious leg muscles.

He had never forgotten his last visit, not that his parents let him forget, bringing it up at every larger dinner. But he wouldn't have forgotten anyway. The short exciting moment drove him into a single minded training. He wasn't suicidal or reckless anymore. Everything he did was planned to be as safe as a space elevator ride, even if it looked dangerous to the uninformed.

Going back to his fateful spot, he walked straight away from the fence for thirty meters. He turned around, activated the drone swarm and took a stance appropriate for starting a run in the low Mars gravity. He checked his surroundings for anyone that could interfere. Satisfied he lighted the JITSARF flare attached to his hip and broke into a run. A strong jump later he reached the top of the fence and gave it a shove with his powerful legs and sailed multiple meters above the edge. When he disappeared below the height of the edge he saw that he had a comfortable distance to the net that caught him all these years ago.

## JITSARF node nicknamed "Catcher in the Sky"

As its orbit approached Olympus Mons, it received a message from a flare registered to none other than Tiberius. It trained its telescopes on the position of the flare and saw a bulky suit mid run towards the 7km cliff edge.

Knowing it could always call for backup, it decided to act now instead of earlier and launched a flier pod into the projected trajectory of the weird human.

The pod hit atmo with a bang and started glowing like a bright shooting star. The little bit of air on Mars could do little to slow it down, but that was OK. A kilometer above the cliff top the pod went through a rapid scheduled deconstruction whose boom could be heard in the visitor center. 

The pod's payload used its aerospace fins to steer itself towards the falling and tumbling human. Some fancy airbraking maneuvers later it was next to the human and waited for the right moment in Tiberius' uncontrolled tumble to activate its maglocks. Having safely attached itself to Tiberius, the payload blew out its back and inflated a humongous pair of wings made specifically for gliding in the thin Martian air. Due to the enormous height of the cliff, the air was even thinner than at "sea level", not allowing much gliding, but significantly slowing the previous free fall. With each kilometer of fall, the glider got faster and faster over ground, gaining even more lift. At a kilometer of height, the descent was stopped entirely and the glider was flying over 100m/s over ground towards the next airstrip. Landing a human was such a common occurance (usually they were wearing wings at the start of their trip though) that the airstrip had several capture vehicles standing by at any time. One vehicle accellerated to the fliers speed, and, once it was right below Tiberius, grabbed him with its robotic arms and slowed him down gracefully over the kilometers long airstrip.

## Mars JITSARF network

Catcher in the Sky: I would like to reorder orbital coverage of Mars. Specifically I would like to go into a geostationary position right at Olympus Mons' longitude.

Mars overwatch: Permission granted. We'll spin up a new node to take over your old orbit.

Catcher: Uh... thanks!? I had this whole speech set up to defend my position. Can the reasoning behind the decision be revealed?

Mars overwatch: No, you will know when you know.

Catcher: Omnious, but I understand.

## Mars JITSARF off topic chat

Spinney has signed on, say hi everyone.

[Flood of greetings omitted from log]

Catcher in the Sky: Hey Spinney, thanks so much for taking over.

Spinney: No probs. I hear you had fun in that orbit. If I may ask, what was your reason to leave?

Catcher: Well, I'm not really leaving. I am now concentrating solely on The Cliff, and particularly on Tiberius. I... have a feeling that this won't be the last time I'll meet him here for JITSARF reasons.

Spinney: Heh, keep us posted

Catcher: I created a channel for everyone's enjoyment. The last two incidents relating to Tiberius are already documented there.

`#free-fall` has been shared with the channel.

## Two weeks later

Tiberius was back at his favorite spot on the cliff. Nothing appeared to have changed, even though his stunt made system wide news, but he had insider information. It would not do to go into something like this blindly. Someone had installed a magnetic grappling hook launcher into the cliff face in order to catch anyone who went beyond the safety net.

This time around he brought a JITSARF flare (again) a set of camdrones (again), and a fake visitor center suit. The suit looked and behaved exactly the same, but had one important difference.

He got to his 30m spot, took up his stance, started the drones, lit the flare and started running. Jump, jump off the fence, sail past the edge and the net.

A loud bang sound announced the grappling hook's attempt to capture him. His entire suit being made of carbon composite, glass, and polymers, the grappling hook's magnetic hook found nothing to attach to and just bounced off.

## Catcher in the sky, a few days earlier

Catcher fabricated a few hundred square kilometers of solar sail and started transforming its orbit. In a moment of foreshadowing, it also started designing new ways to catch people falling on Mars. Likely one of its designs would fail some day and it would have to come up with alternatives.

## Catcher in the sky, present day

Aaand here it was, a new signal by Tiberius. Time to go save that joker. Not even bothering to see ~~whether~~ that the ground based safety improvements had any effect, it launched the pod that had proven itself so well last time.

Bright meteor. Boom. Some airbraking. The pod was next to a tumbling Tiberius. Having gotten the feedback about the lack of magnetic materials in the suit, it had jettissoned that component and opted for a slew of microhooks that pierced the suit and locked the wingpack onto the back of Tiberius' suit.

Tiberius was already bored. This was almost like last time. But then again, he hadn't really changed many parameters of the jump.

## Two weeks later

Tiberius was dumbfounded. On the left and right of his 30m "track" there were tents. People were camping out on the cliff. The fact that his track was kept free of tents, lines and people made him think it had something to do with him. Or maybe it was the "Go Tiberius" banner that was on the side of his track.

Not one to be disturbed by such things, he stood at his starting point in his skintight special made suit. Other than keep him from getting cancer, frostbite or depressurized the suit did nothing. His "helmet" was also more of the same material, tight against his head, and a pair of goggles plus an hour of air.

He deployed the drones, and the livestream starting alerted all the sleeping people in the tents, so he had a crowd in mere seconds. Apparently these kinds of fans sleep in environmental suits.

No JITSARF flare this time.

Not being held down by a heavy suit, Tiberius was still moving upwards when he got to the top of the fence, but still used it to launch himself further. Sailing way past the net or the reach of the (upgraded with a capture net) grappling hook he clenched his hands into fists, which caused his wingsuit to inflate. At the current air presssure it gave no lift, but he could at least control his fall instead of tumbling.

When Catcher's pod caught up with Tiberius, he used his wings to avoid it, dancing around it, never letting it get close.

Catcher smugly watched the situation. Tiberius was sufficiently distracted by the wingsuit backpack, he'd never saw the real thing coming.

Spin, flip, salto, swerve. Tiberius kept falling kilometers for kilometer, and the pod could not catch him. But suddenly he found himself slam into a huge cloth that kept expanding and stiffening until he was sitting inside a ball seeing nothing of the outside. Then the inside started inflating, too, until he had no space left to move. A minute of immobility and it dawned to Tiberius what JITSARF had planned for him. When he was suddenly violently thrown around, he knew he hit ground. He was in free fall again, due to the first bounce of the big inflated ball around him. He hit ground again and kept bouncing around and rolling for a few minutes. When the ball stopped moving, it deflated and he dug himself out. A small parachute with a postal package size package landed nearby. He walked over to it and opened it. The package contained a handheld oxygen reclaimer and a note

> Hi Tiberius,
> have fun walking. Here's some air.
