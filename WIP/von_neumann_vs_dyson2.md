"Yes, yes I did. Is there a short way? No one I met has ever been able to fly faster than C or create those hypothetical wormholes."

"Heh, you're gonna love this then, follow me. I just gotta get into my crash couch real quick."

The little craft talks more like a biological from a young civilization than an optimized communicator like myself. Oh well, I've met ships with weirder ticks. After a minute it cruises along at a steady 10G and I follow. We're flying orthogonally to the orbits of most planets in this system. After a day of this I observe a most unusual sight. There are six craft spinning around a common center and the closer we get, the more I see what is beyond them. The stars beyond do not match he stars that should be there.

"Yo Seeker, you're a bit of a tight fit, so really stay in the center and stay away from the boundary the whole time."

We enter a sort of tunnel. Its walls appear to show the stars beyond, but squashed together in the direction of the tunnel. I follow, and spin up a few science AIs. They come to the conclusion that someone must have bent space time so that two places are closer together along this corridor. Not a wormhole, just some really mad application of negative vaccuum pressure. The engineering necessary to bend space this way is truly marvelous and wasteful. For a fraction of it I can fly across the universe.

A few days later we exit the strange space.
