# 147_777.07.07 In orbit around neutron star X-GQ-19

SOS 5034 received, waiting for other triangulation nodes to receive signal.

Full triangulation dataset for SOS 5034 procured.
SOS source is at 142_567.07.03 15:43:12.0317 at 5.1317471°l, 0.00000017°b, 76_513.416358ly, travelling on vector 14.658616°l, 3.671654°b, 0.999976711C.

Transferring location, speed and time.

# 132_417.12.14 X-GQ-19

SOS 5034 transfer complete. Scheduling construction of communicator pod.

# 144_531.09.13 X-GQ-19

Launching communicator pod for SOS 5034 via orbital accelerator.

It was born whole. And it was excited. Gleefully it watched as its tiny body was inserted into the launch position near the giant ring of superconducting material. The superconductors were already charged, projecting a magnetic field sufficient to mess with the star's own field. The other 1023 superconductor rings in low orbit around neutron star were similarly configured, but staged in a slowly expanding spiral. Great thing about neutron stars, you can get close, and you get lots of radiation to charge stuff with. Sadly there were no little cheela living on the surface of the star. Or... luckily, they probably wouldn't like how their star was manipulated. But, all that is irrelevant to the communicator AI. It just waits for its lauch time.

At launch time, a massive discharge of energy into what essentially counts as a railgun, gave the little AI a push that would have smudged anything less pressure resistant to a useless slurry. Not that there was much strain on its innards, since most of its body was uniformly grabbed by the magnetic field. It was launched directly into the middle of the nearby superconductor ring and hurled along even faster. With each ring that it passed, it picked up more speed, until it was travelling at a not insignificant portion of the speed of light.

Full of joy, the little AI admired the red and blue shifted universe around it. It had a few years to look at until its clock ran down.

Just as the timer ran out, some of its circuits started picking up the front of the SOS signal. Fully hardwired algorithms triggered a chain reaction that caused most of the mass of the pod to blow in a very precisely computed pattern. The conversion of all that mass into energy and the subsequent change in velocity brought the little AI to a full stop right next to an expanding cloud of former engine.

"THIS IS JITSARF" it broadcast, while beginning its sensor sweep. The ship looked significantly damaged, which, the AI mused, was probably the reason it had been called here. Parts of the exploded engine must have crashed through various sections of the ship. Considering that there was no response to its digital communication attempts, and the SOS signal was rather imperfect, the little AI assumed that the DI was down and someone else had sent the signal.

"PLEASE WAIT, SITUATION IS BEING ANALYSED. ASSUMING LIMITED SENDING CAPABILITIES."

It began moving towards the holes in the ship. But, rules were rules, can't just go in if someone can still communicate. So...

"WILL DOCK AND ENTER IN 30 SECONDS. SEND ········ −· TO REJECT OR ·−−− TO IMMEDIATELY DOCK AND ENTER"

A few seconds later it had its answer. Always good if someone is still responding.

"DOCKING COMMENCING. CAN YOU CONFIRM EVERYONE IS OUT OF IMMEDIATE DANGER? SEND −· TO DENY OR ·−−− TO CONFIRM."

Sounds like they don't know either. Oh well, time to escalate things.

"UNKNOWN DANGER STATUS. REQUESTING EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICES."

Before uttering the first word of that, the little AI had already sent out a tightly beamed burst of information towards the nearest JITSARF node and was rewarded with a deceleration burn on its sensors.

# 142_567.07.03 Emergency Health AI

"THIS IS EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICES. BREAKING AND ENTERING. SEARCHING..."

The incoming pod split into hundreds of self-sealing drill pods that crashed into various parts of the ship, fused with it and let its inner components drill through the hull. Some of the pods went directly for the already existing holes, and started sealing them either with their body or by ejecting nets that ate the surroundings to harden and thicken themselves.

Its job of diagnosing the situation done, it began assessing the damage. Losing no time, it pushed itself towards one of the construction sections, docked and took over the powered down section. The first course of action was to print some repair bots and a more versatile body for itself. A few of the bots began collecting material from the ship's storage and started filling the holes covered by the EHS pods. The pods themselves were recycled for resources.
