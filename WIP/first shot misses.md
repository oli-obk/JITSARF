Some 30k years in the future.

Sensor station Juhani was scanning its assigned region of the core of the milky way. Calling it a station was maybe missing the point. It was in fact hundreds of small satellites that made up a 5 light hour diameter interferometer. Irrespective of what it was made up of, it was mapping a small region of the milky way outside of humanity's explored space. It was looking for gravity waves and creating high resolution images of the electromagnetic spectrum. While waiting for a weirdly wobbling star to slowly getting resolved in more detail, it spun up a simulation core to figure out the parameters that would cause a neutron star to behave this weirdly. The simulation core was fed the live input from the still-grainy video feed along with all the raw data. After having run through the parameter space for neutron stars without success, it began experimenting by adding some planets to the simulated system. Nothing added up. That kind of symmetric wobble could not be, even if reality said so... unless... the simulation core did the equivalent of saying "oh no", removed all planets and added a second neutron star. Both stars spun around a point between them, each being attracted by the other, but neither was small enough to be in orbit around the other. Let the simulation run long enough, and you get to the currently observed wobble. The two stars were so close to each other, at this distance they looked like a single wobbling star.

The core gave its conclusion to the sensor station's DS, Juhani, and shut itself down, having fulfilled its purpose. Juhani mentally gulped after processing the summary. Those two stars were months, at best years away from crashing into each other. Their orbits were decaying fast, because these orbits were so short. A short orbit means you're going really fast and changing direction really fast. This spits out a spiral of gravity waves, which means you continuously lose velocity. If you are slower, your orbit becomes smaller, meaning you have even tighter turns to take.

This was above Juhani's paygrade, not that it got paid, mind you, but this was someone else's job to fix, even if it was Juhani's problem, too. It was everyone's problem. If those stars collide, unless you hide behind a lot of material to shield you, the gamma rays from the collision would fry biologicals as well as the tech that ran digital sentients.

# 120 years later

120 light years closer to Earth, a factory and research system received a "maximum - 1" priority message. It had never received a message above priority 2^19, which meant imminent death of unbackupped sentient. So whatever that message was, it seemed like ridiculous overprioritization. It could not imagine what would warrant such a high priority. But, as any good sentience, the receiving DS treated the message by its priority, and processed it immediately with all available resources.

# 12 nanoseconds later

The DS realized the validity of the priorization and broadcast to all of the DSs in sub millisecond light speed range. Immediately a wider broadcast ground the entire factory system to a halt. All resources were put on designing some contraption that could help here.

A few freshly hatched DSs were utterly confused at the chaos that was around them. Their training DS gave them the gist but reduced their available resources to a just-livable level. All resources were needed. One new DS pondered the situation and asked "Hasn't it already exploded? The message is about a collision about to happen, and the message already travelled here since 120 years."

The factory system collectively and virtually facepalmed and forwarded the message plus all their designs to the local JITSARF node. It selected the universally agreed on "awesomest" design. All designs it got had a 100% effectiveness for the problem, so it had to make an arbitrary decision. That design, plus a time and date and some vague instructions were sent Earthwards to an older JITSARF node.
