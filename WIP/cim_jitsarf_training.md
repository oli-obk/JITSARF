# JIT - Cim goes on a field trip

Cim's parents Katu, Brigitte and Shia took the child on a multi day hiking trip on the 5th Birthday. To make the trip interesting beyond the already very exciting wilderness, they booked a JITSARF training with a human. They met up with their JITSARF trainer at the local office near the spaceport. The trainer was a muscular woman with short brown cropped hair, wearing a tank top even in the cold autumn air. She knelt down on the floor to be on head height with Cim and introduced herself.

"Hi, I'm Marina, and who might you be?"

"Cim", the child replied, belatedly adding a "Hi Marina."

"Hi Cim. I have prepared some fun things for you to do on the trip. Wanna see the toys that you're gonna take with you?"

The child was nodding its head excitedly, which made Marina laugh.

"Okay then. Come with me." They walked over to a table with various very different objects lying on it. She grabbed a small long cylinder about the size of a pen and began to explain it:

"This is a training flare. Look, you can pop off the top with one finger. Now there's a red button visible. If you press that button, I will be with you within a few seconds. The adults get a real emergency flare, which should only ever be used in an emergency. Yours is special. You can use it as often as you want during your trip. Try it out now if you want."

She put the lid back on and gave the flare to Cim, who immediately popped it off and pressed the button. A device at Marina's belt beeped. She took it off and showed Cim that the device showed when and where the flare was pressed, as well as a flashing "Cim" in big red letters.

"Ok, so, to the next gadget. This metal box is magic. You can put a message into it, or something like a small toy or book, and then we'll lock the box. The box will be somewhere on your trip. Where, is for you to decide. You decide by pressing the soft part of the key. Then you just need to dig wherever you are standing and it'll be right there."

"Do you have anything with you that you want to put into the box?"

Cim turned to Brigitte, who pulled a tiny plushie out of her backpack and gave it to Cim. Cim gave the plushie to Marina to put into the box.

Marina continued explaining the various other items on the table, like a flashlight, binoculars and a self-hanging hammock.

Cim was now allowed to pack all the things safe for the metal box into a small rucksack. After putting it on Cim's back and adjusting the straps, the family left for the train station to take a trip to the hills where they'd start their hike.
