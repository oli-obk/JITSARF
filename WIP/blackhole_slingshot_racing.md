# Black hole slingshot racing

Various holographic screens go online across an unnamed solar system showing a rocket emblem and a countdown. With the countdown reaching zero, the emblem is replaced by a dark-skinned humanoid figure in a smart jacket with a top hat and a thin but wide mustache. The figure immediately begins shouting in a rolling voice:

"Losers aaand gentlebeings, welcome to the third millennial black hole slingshot racing competition. Please give some applause to our tireless contributors who spent the last ten years getting black holes into position and constructing tribune stations and remote viewing stations."

The figure pauses to wait for the cheering to die down.

"I am Francois and I'll be your host this year. As per tradition, we are starting with the slingshotting competition! Right now!"

More cheering. Each racer has their custom built launcher and custom built capsule. Some are solely practical in design while others sport "enhancements" like spikes to make their opponents afraid or fire decals that they swear makes the pod "go faster".  One pod was even covered in a wooden exterior giving the appearance of a barrel. The vessels were all completely without thrusters, launchers, or anything else that could change the trajectory of the pod by ejecting mass. Of course that didn't stop anyone from moving around mass inside the pod.
