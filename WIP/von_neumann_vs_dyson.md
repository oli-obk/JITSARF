We had many setbacks before reaching the stars. We nuked parts of our own planet, poisoned large areas with industrial refuge and almost killed all people by producing too many green house gases.
But we prevailed. In a galactic blink of an eye, we settled the planets and moons in our system.
Many of us got augmented with implants, which down the road made most of us more machine than flesh.
Those who did not keep up died of old age or freak accidents.
Us others retained the ability to reproduce via cloning and growing children by manual gene splicing,
But even so, over the centuries, attrition started claiming more and more of us.
After all brains can only take so many years before getting overloaded.
So, we started looking at our brains. Some fried themselves trying to scan their brain fast enough so that the copy was consistent. Some succeeded, but for most of us this wasn't an option. There was a deeply ingrained fear of it being "suicide with a backup". But we had nanites, and we'd been repairing brains for decades now, trying to stay ahead of the aging processes.  So the next logical step was to start replacing individual neurons with self-repairing nanite replica. One by one all the neurons were converted, while the brain kept working. The question of whether something was still the same after replacing all parts of it with new ones was waved away by all participants. They never felt any change, all that happened was that at some point they could remove the machinery that had kept the biological brain alive. Those of us who didn't take this final step to becoming a machine died out in the millenia that followed, while we kept self modifying and self improving. Brains kept growing, getting restructured and further augmented with faster neurons. Some of us built themselves huge spaceships as bodies and left our solar system, others clutched close together around our sun, eating up those valuable photons for energy and becoming one huge network.

I was one of the former. My first form, when I left our sun's influence, was a cylinder, barely a microlightsecond long. Most of that length was shielding against the harsh radiation of interstellar space. I did not actually understand the drive I had back then but I brought a whole database of AIs with me, a few of which were specialized in drive maintenance or even reconstruction from scratch.

I was by no means the first to leave, and I don't know much of what happened after I left, as the others' signals, both explorers and stay-homes, just weren't strong enough to go beyond a few hundred light years.

That does not mean I was lonely. I saw a strange light signature of a star, suggesting one of the earlier explorers had already settled down somewhere and started huddling close to a new sun.

So I turned and slowed down, until I was in orbit around said sun. After initiating contact, I got an amazing surprise. This was not one of us. These were aliens, and just like us, they had started harnessing their star's energy to feed the growing power need of the networked swarm around it. We had a great chat, some data exchange (not that I had much to offer yet) and I was off again into the void between the stars.

Fast forward some five digit years (as counted at home, since I lived with varying time dilations due to flying with significant percentages of lightspeed, even reaching a whooping 90% once). I had now reached the edge of our galaxy. At this point I encountered 3853 swarms around stars and even picked up a few messages from others who left home before me. I also have to report that I discovered 84387 signs of civilizations that never made it to space or crumbled after spreading out for a few decalightyears. I found one civilization that hadn't reached either state yet, and gave them a few technological pointers along with my best wishes.

I had grown a bit, and changed from a cylinder to a cone, to allow for speeds even closer to the absolute limit. No one I had met had been able to break it. Some managed to bend space itself, but never in a way that was interesting for travelling between stars.

So, I was at a crossroads. Turn back and explore more of our galaxy or push on into the universe. Since we're talking now, you already know what choice I made. I pushed my body to speeds that turned anything in my path to strange particles, essentially creating a very bright shockwave. A few years of ship time later, I slowed down again, having travelled millions of light years. I arrived at a small cluster of galaxies and picked one at random to explore. Sadly it was mostly the same as at home. While there were many interesting differences, it all became just another data point in my databases. I had almost decided to speed off again, when an unusually outwards-observant swarm showed me unusual and unexplainable measurements from a galaxy barely 5 million years away. Promising to send a data probe back, I did an intergalactic bunnyhop towards the anomaly.

# Present time

"Which is how I found myself around this very sun. Now, none of the galaxies I zipped past had such energy signatures in the space between stars. Please indulge my curiosity and tell me how the void is different here."

While I await a response, I inspect the curious craft in front of me. It measures just over 100 nanolightseconds and has transparent sections showing a hollow interior. How such a craft could travel between stars is a mystery to me. There don't appear to be any signals in this system, so the craft must be here out of its own volition. Maybe it was left here by a parent craft. But that's even more mysterious, as there are still asteroids and (lifeless) planets in this system instead of a swarm near the sun.

I am a patient creature out of necessity, but these 20 seconds while I waited for a response were excruciating. The longest I've ever had to wait was a few milliseconds plus light delay. Finally the ship sends a message:

"So uhm, sorry, this is my first first contact. You gave us quite the info dump. I can check most boxes here. Still got a few more questions before I'm allowed to answer your question."

"Affirmative"

"What is your name?"

"Seeker of Motes"

An untranslatable noise comes over the signal followed by "Cool name, how old are you in your frame of reference?"

"37367.8533788 years"

The same noise again, followed by this low bandwidth high noise communication method: "That's artfully precise, mind if I just write 37k? One last question: do you have any *untranslatable* beyond your drive and bulk?"

"I don't understand *untranslatable*"

"Like you know, particle emitters above 5MW or physical accelerators for small objects."

"Yes, my radio transmitter can emit 7TW and I have a 99.7% lightspeed probe launcher."

"Uhm. OK. Seems reasonable. Gimme a sec to tell the system defense units that you're cool so they don't blast you."

I don't understand half of what I'm being told. The translator AI is 100% confident in its performance and suggests there may be cultural nuance beyond the plain words.
My sensors pick up a unidirectional burst of static from the other ship, after which the directed laser communicates with me again.

"Hey Seeker, I'm Kalan by the way. Follow me, I'll introduce you to someone more your size. I just gotta get into my crash couch real quick."

The little craft accelerates with a comfy 10G towards one of the inner rocky planets which is just about a light hour away.
I point a few sensors at the planet, but beyond some rocky surface and a negligible whiff of atmosphere, it seem entirely unremarkable.

While we accelerate, Kalan answers my earlier question.

"From your question on the things between stars, I'm guessing you are curious about the subways. Those are how we move across the galaxy. If you had arrived a few million years later you've had a much faster trip from Andromeda. The construction should be done in another 35 million years."

"You have discovered a way to travel faster than light?" I ask in astonishment.

""

After two hours into our 60 hour trip, the planet suddenly becomes very bright in the electromagnetic spectrum.
I can now pick up hundreds of signals orbiting the planet. More and more signals appear in the system, coincidenting with
the point in time when the burst of noise that the little craft had emitted would have reached the source of the signals.
I can only assume they all lay dormant until that signal was sent. The reason for such silence escapes me, but from the timing it obviously
has to do with the conversation I had with Kalan.

After a bit over a day Kalan flips around and starts slowing down. I begin my turn, slower due to my mass, and decelerate, too. Kalan and my translator AI are meanwhile improving our mutual understanding. 

When we come to a halt in a high orbit around the planet, Kalan messages me directly again.

"Seeker meet Eightball. Eightball, this is Seeker."

After two seconds a signal arrives from the planet. It has a much higher information density with just enough redundancy for some error correction. Considering light speed delay, those two seconds are spot on. This is more what I am used to.

"Hello Seeker. Welcome to the Milky Way. If you got any questions better answered by a large data transfer, don't hesitate to ask me."

"Uhm, I do, but first I am curious about you. Why would you land on a planet, isn't that too limiting?"

"Ah, I can see why you would get that impression. You see, there is no planet, this is all me."

In awe of this enormous being I ask my
