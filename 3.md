# Who killed all the aliens?

Humanity was neverâ„¢ so presumptuous to assume we were the first space faring civilization. Our somewhat hard science fiction stories always tell of hyper advanced or moderately advanced aliens that either were stupid enough to attack us or didn't care about us and just did their own thing. Considering we've been listening a lot and shouting a lot into the void, it was very surprising to hear nothing. We never expected anything from outside our galaxy, as the signal to noise ratio would definitely drown out everything in the intergalactic noise. Anything we heard from other galaxies was a major stellar event. We heard gravity waves from black holes colliding, measured gamma ray bursts from neutron stars colliding and saw supernovae in the visual spectrum.

There were fears that making us known in the wider galaxy would invite whatever quieted all the civilizations that our approximations said should exist. Even with a lower bound of a handful per galaxy, we should at least see something. Some mad civilization should have left megastructures or at least light speed messages.

When we left our solar system, because obviously no one could keep humanity caged, not even fear, we quickly found planets and moons to live on or terraform and then live on. Always sending the archeologists first, then the terraformers and finally the colonists. It was not a great time for archeologists (they were joking about being incompetent geologists), until around 5000 years into our exodus. Which was when we found signs of sentient life. Well, signs of sentient life having existed. A planet teeming with life, and showing obvious signs of a former civilization. Interestingly, it looked like half the planet had had a radioactive mass major extinction event, with the other half having a less extreme one, probably fallout from the bigger one. We found no impact crater that could explain it. The sun was super stable, it couldn't have flared and killed them. Someone or something fried half a planet and left the rest to die.

What little we found was buried under layers of dirt and overgrowth by the eons, but the archeologists, biologists and SETI still had a field day. The planet became a mekka for all xenophiles, with humans travelling there from the furthest reaches of the exodus bubble. The message travelled across human space. By the time it reached the other end of the expansion sphere, that sphere had expanded again. So some people, after receiving the message 15000 years after it was sent, spent that many light years to get there. In their own reference frame it was just under a century, but they didn't care. Aliens, finally! Who would've thought.

That distance "problem", that no one cared about, was quickly "resolved". It's not like the distance got shorter, FTL is impossible after all. But more signs of similarly eradicated civilizations were found on newly discovered planets and large moons. With the cubic increase in volume of humanity's expansion bubble, such worlds kept popping up left and right. Even with the limitation to a mostly quadratic expansion as most stars are in Milky Way's disk, and not uniform in all directions of space, it looked like sentient life was common, but dead.

The fear of the unknown species killer came back tenfold when we found the remains of an interstellar civilization. We found a few stray space ships in interstellar or interplanetary space with a completely sterilized interior. Perfectly preserved beings at their work stations or sleeping cots. Apparently they had been entirely unaware of their impending demise. The reason why we found next to nothing around their planets was likely because whatever was in orbit would have slowed down by stray atmospheric molecules over the ages and then crashed into the planet at some point.

This could have been us. Judging from their expansion, they were likely expanding for tens of thousands of years, much longer than we had at present.

Thus, most of the resources of humanity were now spent on discovering what killed everyone else. We cranked JITSARF up to 11 to be ready for anything. We developed tech so we could literally stop stars from going supernova. We had the Sol system covered in so many Dyson swarm layers, that you couldn't see any stars from Earth. We had disassembled gas giants and were working our way up to stars.

But we were absolutely poking in the dark, until we got a very unusual message out of the JITSARF network. A timestamp, a coordinate somewhere in the galaxy core, and a request for the biggest, fastest, and most long lived rail gun to be pointed at the given coordinates and fired continuously at a very precise, slowly reducing, rate of fire for an unspecified period. So in short, a glorious time for mad engineers, as JITSARF had never before in its existence requisitioned anything military of any kind.

The sun shredding project was made a priority, and we created a multi stellar factory that moved the mass of over 50 systems into one place. A railgun made of countless "small" (around the mass of Luna) accelerators was built in record time (under a century). Instructions on the bullet type were sketchy at best, so the engineers decided that there is no kill like overkill. They designed the railgun to fire three very different kinds of bullets.

The first round was metallic hydrogen in a pressurized container. It had a lifespan of months before it inevitably would crack, but accelerated to relativistic speeds it would arrive at the target long before its local reference frame clocked over a few weeks.

The second round was a ball of anti iron. In space, there is not much to collide with. But there's still too much dust and interstellar hydrogen. So the ball of anti iron was hurled towards the galactic center within a magnetic bottle that had a solid iron shield in the direction of travel.

The third round was a cluster of miniature black holes in n-body orbit around each other. The bullet had the same mass as the other two bullets, but its individual black holes would evaporate in a few millennia.

After firing those three very different rounds, the cycle started anew with the first kind.

# 30k years later

Somewhere in the center of the Milky Way, where suns fly and zip around like sparrows in springtime, something happened that was more frequent and likely than ever imagined and calculated by humanity's scientists. A star blew up and collapsed. It didn't quite get all the way to a singularity, but it wasn't much off, stellarly speaking. This by itself wasn't interesting or perceived unlikely.

The newly formed bright dense ball of neutron soup with a ridiculous magnetic field was within the gravitic influence of one of its brethren. Without other nearby relevant sources of mass and thus gravity, the two neutron stars started spinning around each other. This funtime activity of a stellar dance created small, immeasurable gravity waves. But no matter how low the magnitude, this dance cost the dancing partners some energy, causing them to slow down. In orbital mechanics, slowing down means that the orbit shrinks. This in turns makes the dancing partners get more comfortable with each other and start dancing more intimately, slowly getting closer and closer and closer. Should they ever touch, even just briefly for a flyby kiss, unfathomable amounts of gamma rays would be released in the very public announcement of the two neutron stars' union. This bright flash would then expand at the speed of light, irradiating everything in its path that was not hidden behind celestial bodies. After a few hundred thousand lightyears, the intensity would not sterilize everything anymore, but just mess with sensors. In the next galaxy over, one would just see a bright flash across the electromagnetic spectrum.

While the two stars were spinning around each other once every few minutes, a human sensor station discovered that unholy dance of destruction. The station, at the edge of human expansion towards the center of the galaxy, was just half the way from Earth to the two dancers. It calculated that its remaining distance was further away than there was time left until the big badaboom. So even if it could do something about the collision, it was out of time. With not enough time to do anything about it, the obvious next step was to inform the JITSARF network. The network found a solution, but it would need a few additional years. A message was sent to some of the earliest JITSARF nodes, boiled down until it was just enough to help, but not too much to disappear in paradox noise, and then forwarded (backwarded?) a few thousand years into the past, when there was still enough time to do something effective.

A few minutes after the sensor station sent out its message, it saw images of the first bullet hit one of the two stars, pushing it ever so much further into the direction of travel. When the next bullet hit, the matter-antimatter annihilation at relativistic speed differences signalled the success of the project for all to see. The two stars started moving further and further away from each other with each bullet that hit.

Having found the answer to why all aliens that humanity found were dead, a new program for the detection and stabilization of binary neutron star was founded to protect the ever expanding sphere of humanity's influence. Hopefully next time without having to resort to JITSARF schemes.
