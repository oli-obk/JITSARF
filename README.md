The source of the JITSARF stories lives and evolves here.

It is a collection of hard science fiction stories with HFY elements, all within the same universe.

# Contributions

Contributions of any kind are very welcome. Some examples (though I may be missing some important ones, so just ask):

* PRs for typo fixes
* issues opened for timeline problems
* issues opened for non-hard-scifi parts that should get rewritten
* PRs for your own stories (I can dream that this will happen)
* issues opened for any kind of problem with story components (e.g. like abusive or discriminatory character interaction)
