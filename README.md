The source of the JITSARF stories lives and evolves here.

It is a collection of hard science fiction stories with HFY elements, all within the same universe.

The divergence from full hard scifi is that you can send messages back in time as long as they only affect your own future and not your past.

# WARNING

Enter the WIP directory on your own risk. It contains enormous spoilers for the overarching story.

# Contributions

Contributions of any kind are very welcome. Some examples (though I may be missing some important ones, so just ask):

* PRs for typo fixes
* issues opened for timeline problems
* issues opened for non-hard-scifi parts that should get rewritten
* PRs for your own stories (I can dream that this will happen)
* issues opened for any kind of problem with story components (e.g. like abusive or discriminatory character interaction)
